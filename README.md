# readme-generator

For this challenge we had to create a ReadMe generator. To do this we had to use node.js and download the inquirer npm. From this we then also linked different js files using .exports so that functions were available when stored on another file. Using inquirer we prompt the user in the terminal to enter the details needed to include in a ReadMe file. We then used MarkDown to style the read me.
